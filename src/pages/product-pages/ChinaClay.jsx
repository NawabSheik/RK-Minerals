          China clay is valued for its whiteness,
          brightness, and fine particle size. It is widely used in ceramics,
          paper, paints, soaps and rubber industries. Its chemical inertness, low
          shrinkage, and high opacity make it a versatile mineral for both
          functional and aesthetic - industrial applications.
